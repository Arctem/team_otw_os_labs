INTRODUCTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this project is to implement a virtual file system. This disk has
8192 blocks of 4KB each, making the disk take up a total of 32MB. The file system
supports at most 64 files, with files being no larger than 16MB.

COMPILATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build this program, simply run the provided Makefile by running 'make'.

COMMAND EXPLANATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run this program, run './test'. This will create the virtual file system on a
'disk' named 'disk.dat'.

DATA STRUCTURES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We used some structures and implemented some functions for our virtual file
system in order to work properly.

block_map_t: A map of the blocks
file_meta_t: File metadata
block_list_t: A list of the blocks
make_fs(): Make the file system
mount_fs(): Mount the file system
umount_fs(): Unmount the file system
fs_open(): Open a file in the file system
fs_close(): Close a file in the file system
fs_create(): Create a file in the file system
fs_delete(): Delete a file in the file system
fs_read(): Read a file in the file system
fs_write(): Write to a file in the file system
fs_get_filesize(): Get the size of a file in the file system
fs_lseek(): Set the file pointer to a specific point in the file
fs_truncate(): Truncate the file to a specific length
