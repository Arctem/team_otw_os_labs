Team Omega Tiger Woods OS Lab Project 3

The purpose of this project is to create a program to simulate the synchronization
problem of the classic Producer-Consumer problem. This program does this by
creating a thread for each producer and consumer, and creating a single buffer
that each producer and consumer can access. This buffer is limited to a size of
10. Each producer and consumer can access the buffer only when the buffer is not
being accessed by another producer or consumer. Producers can add numbers to the
buffer, and consumers can remove numbers from it.
